# File_system
PROJECT_OVERVIEW:
-----------------------------------------------------------
This project implements a Unix-like file system that organizes data into named blocks called files. Files are structured hierarchically in a tree-like organization of directories. The program operates in interactive mode through a command-line interface (CLI).
The file system supports essential operations for directories, regular files, symbolic links, and metadata management, providing functionality similar to Unix-based systems.
